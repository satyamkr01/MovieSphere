3. **Movie Details**: Click on a movie to see details like its name, description, language, rating, and more.
4. **Search**: Use the search option to find any movie directly from the server.
5. **Favorite Movie**: Add your favorite movies to the list using **Room Database** and swipe to remove them easily.
